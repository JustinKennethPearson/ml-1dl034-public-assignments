    "Logistic regression (LR) is a statistical method for analysing datasets where there are one of more independent variables that determine the outcome. The outcome is a dichotomous, meaning there are only two possible outcomes (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False). For instance, if you want to predict the sex of a person from age ($x_1$) and income ($x_2$), the logistic regression model would be\n",

    "\n",
    "LR estimates a probability (between 0 and 100%) but $h(x)$ gives values in $(-\\infty, +\\infty)$. We need to \"squish\" $h(x)$ to restrict it to a suitable range. LR commonly uses the logistic function (a.k.a. sigmoid function) to compute probabilities: \n",

Gradient descent is an iterative process of minimizing a function by following the gradients of a pre-defined cost function.
