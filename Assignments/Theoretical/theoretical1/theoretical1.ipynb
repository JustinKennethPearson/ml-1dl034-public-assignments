    "# Tweet classification with naive bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we are going to implement a naive bayes classifier for classifying tweets about Trump or Obama based on the words in the tweet. Recall that for two events A and B the bayes theorem says\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where P(A) and P(B) is the ***class probabilities*** and P(B|A) is called ***conditional probabilities***. this gives us the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. So as an example if we want to find the probability of \"is this a tweet about Trump given that it contains the word \"president\" \" we will obtain the following \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{\"Trump\"}|\\text{\"president\" in tweet}) = \\frac{P(\"\\text{\"president\" in tweet}|\\text{\"Trump\"})P(\\text{\"Trump\"})}{P(\"\\text{\"president\" in tweet})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that to find the probability of \"is this a tweet about Trump given that it contains the word \"president\" \" we need the probability of \"president\" being in a tweet about Trump, the probability of a tweet being about Trump and the probability of \"president\" being in a tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if we want to obtain the opposite \"is this a tweet about Obama given that it contains the word \"president\" \"\n",
    "we get \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{\"Obama\"}|\\text{\"president\" in tweet}) = \\frac{P(\\text{\"president\" in tweet}|\\text{\"Obama\"})P(\\text{\"Obama\"})}{P(\\text{\"president\" in tweet})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we need the probability of \"president\" being in a tweet about Obama, the probability of a tweet being about Obama and the probability of \"president\" being in a tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now build a classifier where we compare those two probabilities and whichever is the larger one it's classified as \n",
    "\n",
    "if P(\"Trump\"|\"president\" in tweet) $>$ P(\"Obama\"|\"president\" in tweet)\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Tweet is about Trump\n",
    "\n",
    "else\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Tweet is about Obama\n",

    "Now let's expand this to handle multiple features and put the Naive assumption into bayes theroem. This means that if features are independent we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A,B) = P(A)P(B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|b_1,b_2,...,b_n) = \\frac{P(b_1|A)P(b_2|A)...P(b_n|A)P(A)}{P(b_1)P(b_2)...P(b_n)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|b_1,b_2,...,b_n) = \\frac{\\prod_i^nP(b_i|A)P(A)}{P(b_1)P(b_2)...P(b_n)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So with our previous example expanded with more words \"is this a tweet about Trump given that it contains the word \"president\" and \"America\" \" gives us \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{\"Trump\"}|\\text{\"president\", \"America\" in tweet}) = \\frac{P(\\text{\"president\" in tweet}|\\text{\"Trump\"})P(\\text{\"America\" in tweet}|\\text{\"Trump\"})P(\\text{\"Trump\"})}{P(\\text{\"president\" in tweet})P(\\text{\"America\" in tweet})} $$\n",
