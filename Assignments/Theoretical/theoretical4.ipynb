    "## Introduction to the entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy is a measure of information, used in many fields, including physics, statistics and machine learning. It describes how much order or disorder there is in random variables (r.v.) or sequences. For instance, if Alice tosses a fair coin and records the result, how many bits of information does she need to send it to Bob so that he knows the result as well? He needs exactly one bit (0 = heads, 1 = tail) on average. We always assume they both know what the setup of the experiment is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entropy is written $H(x)$ and is defined as:\n",
    "$H(x) = \\mathbb{E}[-log_2(x)] = - \\Sigma_{i=1}^N p(x_i) log_2(p(x_i))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit of intuition:\n",
    "1. As a measure of information, we want the entropy to be additive. If you get one e-mail, you get n bits of information, if you get two e-mails, you get n+m bits of information. Unfortunately, when two independant random variables are realized, they are multiplied together : $p(x_a \\cap x_b) = p(x_a)p(x_b)$. In order to make them additive, the logarithm function can be used: $\\log p(x_a \\cap x_b) = \\log p(x_a) + \\log p(x_b)$. \n",
    "2. The rarer the event, the more information must be transferred when it occurs. For instance, if a coin is rigged and always gives tail, Alice doesn't even need to send anything to Bob, since he already know that it will be tail. Remember that both Alice and Bob know the exact setup of the experiment. Newspaper tend to follow this trend as well: they don't talk about how the sun will rise this morning, talk a bit about the weather forecast (a few numbers) but might dedicate a full page to the new, shiney and overhyped tv-series dedicated to the life of Carl XVI Gustaf. So the amount of information is invertly proportional to the probability: $1/p(x)$.\n",
    "3. So far we have $log_2(1/(p(x)) = -log_2(p(x))$, and we take its expectation such that it gives the average information in a random variable. Note that the base of the log is arbitrary, you will often see either $e$ or $2$ as a base. I personnaly enjoy using $log_2$ because the entropy will be in bits which is easier to interpret (with $e$, the entropy will be in nats).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Entropy of the Normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the (base 2) entropy of a Normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pdf of the Normal distribution is: $\\exp(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}) / \\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}$.\n",
    "You need to find: $\\mathbb{E}[-log_2(\\exp(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}) / \\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2})]$\n",
    "Do it step-by-step, first the log (base 2), then flip the signs, then take the expectation of the remaining formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result will be: $\\frac{1}{2} log_2(2 \\pi e \\sigma^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulas to use (or not, as you want, who am I to dictate anything?):\n",
    "* $\\log_2(a*b) = \\log_2(a) + \\log_2(b)$\n",
    "* $\\log_2(x) = \\log(x)/\\log(2)$\n",
    "* $\\log_2(\\exp(u)) = u/\\log(2)$. Be careful!! The $\\log_2$ is no longer base 2 in the right hand side, but base $e$.\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{E}[ax + by] = a\\mathbb{E}[x] + b\\mathbb{E}[y]$. That means that all the constants go out of the expectation. In this case, both $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ are constants. $x$ is not constant.\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{E}[x] = \\mu$ and $\\mathbb{V}[x] = \\sigma^2$.\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{E}[(x - \\mu)^2 / \\sigma^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(x - \\mu)^2] / \\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{V}[x] / \\sigma^2 = \\sigma^2/\\sigma^2 = 1$\n",
    "* $1/\\log(2) = \\log_2(2^{1/log(2)}) = \\log_2(e)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have found the entropy of a normal distribution we can wonder about the intuitive meaning of the thing. First, the entropy has only one variable: $\\sigma^2$. Let's imagine a friend of yours invented a new die that, when tossed gives you a random number sampled from a normal distribution (rounded to the nearest integer). He calls it the Normal Die ™️ (confusing name, I know, there's already a lot of hatred for the normal distribution being called that way). Like for a regular die, where you know the probability of each face, you are given the mean and the variance. If I buy one such die, and toss it, how many bits do I need to send to you for you to know which value is displayed on the die? The entropy formula gives you that, but:\n",
    "* If the mean is 0, 20 or -37, the entropy doesn't change. This is because you know the mean is common knowledge, and your friend only needs to send the deviation from the mean to you. If the mean is 20, he tosses the dice and get 24, but only needs to send 24-20=+4 (2 bits, plus a sign bit = 3 bits in total) to you. When you get the result: +4, you just have to add the mean to recover the true number. Remember that the mean and variance are common knowledge.\n",
    "* The bigger $\\sigma^2$, the bigger the variance and the more bits I need to send to you.\n",
    "This is what the formula above states, meaning entropy is also a measure of uncertainty. More variance means more bits to send, so a bigger entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced note: you might notice that if the variance is 0, the log is negative ($- \\infty$) do not get confused, and just considered that negative entropies get clipped to 0 bits. This works because we rounded the values generated by the continuous normal distribution."

    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Find and write down the formula for the entropy of a bernoulli variable on the internet. Wikipedia is an excellent resource in statistics (and often reliable, but don't cite it still). Do not forget to change the $log$ into $log_2$!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: The formula involves $x * log_2(x)$. What happens when $x = 0$? We get $0 * -\\infty = I.F.$, so this is clearly not the right approach. The good way of finding out what happens is by applying [L'Hôpital's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule) and finding the limit of $x * log(x)$ when $x$ approaches 0. You can either do it as an exercise if you think it's fun (it is quick and rewarding in practice, give it a shot :), or you can look up the answer in the Wikipedia page above.\n",
    "\n",
