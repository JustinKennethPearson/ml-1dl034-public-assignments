    "# Tweet classification with naive bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we are going to implement a naive bayes classifier for classifying positive or negative based on the words in the tweet. Recall that for two events A and B the bayes theorem says\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where P(A) and P(B) is the ***class probabilities*** and P(B|A) is called ***conditional probabilities***. this gives us the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. So as an example if we want to find the probability of \"is this a positive tweet given that it contains the word \"good\" \" we will obtain the following \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{``positive\"}|\\text{``good\" in tweet}) = \\frac{P(\\text{``good\" in tweet}|\\text{``positive\"})P(\\text{``positive\"})}{P(\\text{``good\" in tweet})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that to find the probability of \"is this a positive tweet given that it contains the word \"good\" \" we need the probability of \"good\" being in a positive tweet, the probability of a tweet being positive and the probability of \"good\" being in a tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we want to obtain the opposite \"is this a negative tweet given that it contains the word \"boring\" \"\n",
    "we get \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{``negative\"}|\\text{``boring\" in tweet}) = \\frac{P(\\text{``boring\" in tweet}|\\text{``negative\"})P(\\text{``negative\"})}{P(\\text{``boring\" in tweet})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we need the probability of \"boring\" being in a negative tweet, the probability of a tweet negative being and the probability of \"boring\" being in a tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now build a classifier where we compare those two probabilities and whichever is the larger one it's classified as \n",
    "\n",
    "if P(\"positive\"|\"good\" in tweet) $>$ P(\"negative\"|\"boring\" in tweet)\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Tweet is positive\n",
    "\n",
    "else\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Tweet is negative\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's expand this to handle multiple features and put the Naive assumption into bayes theroem. This means that if features are independent we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A,B) = P(A)P(B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|b_1,b_2,...,b_n) = \\frac{P(b_1|A)P(b_2|A)...P(b_n|A)P(A)}{P(b_1)P(b_2)...P(b_n)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|b_1,b_2,...,b_n) = \\frac{\\prod_i^nP(b_i|A)P(A)}{P(b_1)P(b_2)...P(b_n)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So with our previous example expanded with more words \"is this a positive tweet given that it contains the word \"good\" and \"interesting\" \" gives us \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{``positive\"}|\\text{``good\", ``interesting\" in tweet}) = \\frac{P(\\text{``good\" in tweet}|\\text{``positive\"})P(\\text{``interesting\" in tweet}|\\text{``positive\"})P(\\text{``positive\"})}{P(\\text{``good\" in tweet})P(\\text{``interesting\" in tweet})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the denominator remains constant which means we can remove it and the final classifier end up\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = argmax_A P(A)\\prod_i^nP(b_i|A) $$"

Also, we change the labels from 0 for \"Negative\" and 1 for \"Positive\" to \"Neg\" and \"Pos\" respectively. For each word convert it to lower case.
