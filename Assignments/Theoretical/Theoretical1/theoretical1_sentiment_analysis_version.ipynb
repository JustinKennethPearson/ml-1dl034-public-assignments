    "# Tweet classification with naive bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we are going to implement a naive bayes classifier for classifying positive or negative based on the words in the tweet. Recall that for two events A and B the bayes theorem says\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where P(A) and P(B) is the ***class probabilities*** and P(B|A) is called ***conditional probabilities***. this gives us the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. So as an example if we want to find the probability of \"is this a positive tweet given that it contains the word \"good\" \" we will obtain the following \n",

    "\n",
    "This means that to find the probability of \"is this a positive tweet given that it contains the word \"good\" \" we need the probability of \"good\" being in a positive tweet, the probability of a tweet being positive and the probability of \"good\" being in a tweet. \n",

    "Similarly, if we want to obtain the opposite \"is this a negative tweet given that it contains the word \"boring\" \"\n",

    "\n",
    "This gives us:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So with our previous example expanded with more words \"is this a positive tweet given that it contains the word \"good\" and \"interesting\" \" gives us \n",
